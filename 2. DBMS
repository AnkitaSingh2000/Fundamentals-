Q5. What do you understand by query optimization?
Query optimization is the phase that identifies a plan for evaluation query that has the least estimated cost. This phase comes into the picture when there are a lot of algorithms and methods to execute the same task.

The advantages of query optimization are as follows:
1. The output is provided faster
2. A larger number of queries can be executed in less time
3. Reduces time and space complexity


Q6. Do we consider NULL values the same as that of blank space or zero? 
A NULL value is not at all same as that of zero or a blank space. The NULL value represents a value which is unavailable, unknown, assigned or not applicable whereas zero is a number and blank space is a character.


Q7. What do you understand by aggregation and atomicity?
Aggregation	Atomicity
This is a feature of the E-R  model which allows a relationship set to participate in another relationship set.	
This property states that a database modification must either follow all the rules or nothing at all. So, if one part of the transaction fails, then the entire transaction fails.


Q8. What are the different levels of abstraction in the DBMS?
There are three levels of data abstraction in DBMS. They are:

1. Physical Level: It is the lowest level of abstraction and describes how the data is stored.
2. Logical Level: This is the next level of abstraction after the Physical level. This layer determines what data is stored in the database, and what is the relationship between the data points.
3. View Level: The View Level is the highest level of abstraction and it describes only a part of the entire database.
